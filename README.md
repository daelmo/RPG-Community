# RPG-Community
An online community for textbased roleplay games. 
Goal is to build a plattform so friends can create characters, play some roles and write their stories and plots together.
RPGs give a lot of room for creativity, crazyness, interactions and for laying plans.
A big part of RPG is the fanfiction scene aswell.
With this plattform dedicated to RPGs I want to help theam out of the unsuitable world of forum.

## Note
* This platform was already written in procedural code. This is the try to build it more open and structured in OOP with PHP.
* I refused to use a framework, because I want to execise programming in objektoriented languages.

## Languages
* PHP
* CSS
* HTML
* Javascript
* AngularJS
* MySQL

## Todo
* finish the prepared statements
* overwork the MySQL requests 
* bring the survey back to work
* bring the profile back to work
* bring the rpgs back to work
* build relationsystem: block, follow, unfollow, unblock
